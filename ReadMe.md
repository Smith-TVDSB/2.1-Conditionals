# 2.1A Modify the iron throne program

### Modify the program so that:
1. The user can enter in a first name
2. The user can enter the last name
3. If the last name is Baratheon then they have a claim to the throne
4. Don't forget to fix the output screen (don't say targareon) 
BONUS: Make the if statement work with both upper and lower case
